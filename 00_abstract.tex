\begin{abstract}

Server-side computation is difficult in Accumulo 
due to its design for distributed storage and not for general computing,
yet many big data applications such as enrichment and analytics \todo{use more specific example}
compute on Accumulo data and persist results back to Accumulo anyway.
Users must subsequently implement complex clients and shuffle 
data between Accumulo storage and engines for compute.

In this work we enable SpGEMM, sparse matrix multiplication,
server-side on Accumulo tables
by repurposing Accumulo iterators.
We compare mathematics and performance 
of inner and outer product approaches 
and show how an outer product implementation scales with synthetic experiments.
% part of the Graphulo library
We offer our work as a first step for the Graphulo library
that will deliver linear algebra primitives server-side on Accumulo.

% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the conference you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals/conferences frown on
% math in the abstract anyway.
