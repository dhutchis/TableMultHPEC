\begin{abstract}
The Apache Accumulo database excels at distributed storage
and indexing
and is ideally suited for storing graph data.
%yet are not designed for general computing.
%However,
Many big data graph analytics
compute on graph data and persist the results back to the database.
These graph calculations are often best performed inside the database server. 
%The Graphulo library is designed to take advantage of 
%Accumulo's graph capabilities
%Users must subsequently implement complex clients and shuffle 
%data between Accumulo storage and computing engines.
%% Server-side computation is difficult in Accumulo 
%% due to its design for distributed storage and not for general computing,
%% yet many big data applications such as enrichment and analytics \todo{use more specific example}
%% compute on Accumulo data and persist results back to Accumulo anyway.
%% Users must subsequently implement complex clients and shuffle 
%% data between Accumulo storage and engines for compute.
The GraphBLAS standard provides a compact and efficient approach for implementing
a wide range of graph applications with a small number of sparse matrix operations. 
%we propose 
We implement the GraphBLAOS sparse matrix multiplication
inside Accumulo databaes server
by leveraging Accumulo's native, high-performance iterators.
We compare the mathematics and the performance 
of both inner-product and outer-product implementations 
and show how an outer-product implementation achieves optimal performance near
the peak write rate of Accumulo.
% part of the Graphulo library
We offer our work as a core component to the Graphulo library
that will deliver matrix mathematics primitives for graph analytics within Accumulo.

% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the conference you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals/conferences frown on
% math in the abstract anyway.
